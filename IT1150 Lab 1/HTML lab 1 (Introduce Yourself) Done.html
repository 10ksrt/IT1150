    </h2>
    <p>I've always been around technology my whole life; I also happenned to be the "family tech guy" as a kid. As I grew older I only became more interested in technology and how to operate it. Eventually, I started creating web sites for people as a business service and I wantex to grow my skill and passion for the craft by going attending Tri c.

    <h2>Your goals after graduating from Tri-C.
    </h2>
    <p> After graduting tri C, I want to pursure a certificate in Visual Design and CISSP because I am proficient in visual design and I know the CISSP can open up more opportunities for me to live abroad and make a living for myself. 
        Than I would pursue obtaining my bachelor's degree in IT as well. I will most likely attend Central or Shaw University depending on tuition and where i'm living at the time. </p>
